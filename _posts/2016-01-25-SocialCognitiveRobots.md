A **social robot** is an autonomous robot that interacts and communicates with humans or other autonomous physical agents by following social behaviors and rules attached to its role. On the other hand, **cognitive robotics** is concerned with endowing a robot with intelligent behavior by providing it with a processing architecture that will allow it to learn and reason about how to behave in response to complex goals in a complex world.

## Description

I am mainly interested in how to make social robots more intelligent for a human-robot interaction.

There are many sources that says the origin of HRI as a discrete problem was stated by 20th-century author Isaac Asimov in 1941, in his novel "_I, Robot_". He states the _Three Laws of Robotics_ that I personally love,

> First Law. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\s\s

> Second Law. A robot must obey any orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\s\s

> Third Law. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
