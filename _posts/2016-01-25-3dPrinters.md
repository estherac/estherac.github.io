3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file. A 3D printer is a type of industrial robot.

## Description

Together with my team from the <a href="http://ieee.uc3m.es/">Robotics Society (ASROB) & IEEE Student Branch</a> at the UC3M, we maintained a "Printed Valley" which is a placed where there are two 3d printers available for  student projects.

We are interested mainly

Furthermore, I created a collaboration between ASROB and <a href="https://crea-robotica.com/">CREA Educational Robotics</a> in which we do a workshop for constructing your own Open Source low-cost 3d printer as showed in <b><i>Figure</i></b> from above.
