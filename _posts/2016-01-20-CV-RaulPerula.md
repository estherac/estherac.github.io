   description: In a collaboration between the University Rey Juan Carlos I (URJC) and Google, the goal of this project is to explore the use of Scratch with robots, both simulated and real. JdeRobot is a project that allows and simplifies the use of them. We started with simulated robots in Gazebo, despite with real robots because the interfaces are the same. This project expected to develop a new tool prototype that reads Scratch programs and translate them into ROS-Python components.

## Summary

Raúl Pérula-Martínez was born in Cordoba, Spain, 1988. He received his BSc in [Technical Engineering in Computer Science Systems](http://www.uco.es/eps/node/87) at the [University of Cordoba](http://www.uco.es/) in 2009. In 2011 he completed another BSc in [Computer Science Engineering](http://www.uco.es/eps/node/99)  in the same university. While he was working as Jr. Software Engineer for the company Mirada PLC, he finished his MSc in Robotics and Automation at the [University Carlos III of Madrid](http://www.uc3m.es/) in 2013. In 2012, he started as a member of the [Robotics Society and IEEE Student Branch](http://ieee.uc3m.es/) at the UC3M, being the _Chairman_ since 2014.
From 2013 to 2017, he was working in his Ph.D. in _Robotics_ at the same university. During this time he was working in the _Social Robots_ group at the _RoboticsLab_, UC3M. The goal of his Ph.D. project was to exploit insights from neuroscience and psychology in order to implement a model of a Cognitive Architecture including a **Decision-Making** system for Socially Interactive Robots. He is also teacher of some subjects related to Robotics and Computer Science.
He also collaborated as a Visiting Assistance in Research at the [Social Robotics Lab](http://scazlab.yale.edu/) in Yale University.
