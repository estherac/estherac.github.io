   description: I focused on improving the low and high-level capabilities of the social robot Maggie, by implementing a bio-inspired decision-making system able to learn from Human-Robot Interaction. The robot is equipped with a whole-body artificial skin and learns the consequences of its interaction with the self and the environment by means of a multisensory (tactile-motor and tactile-visual) representation. This results in the extension of the robot's tactile domain toward the nearby space, in such a way that it implicitly copes with modeling or calibration errors. Finally, this representation is then exploited with a sensory-based guidance of the motor actions performed by the robot. That is, an avoidance and catching controller capable of using any body part in order to either prevent collision with or come into contact with incoming objects.

   description: I developed an artificial vision machine learning system using ROS in order to improve the detection and the identification of daily use objects. Specifically, I implemented a SIFT-based system able to integrate between the 2D (SIFT) and 3D (PointCloud) information coming from a kinect camera. The system proved to be successful in improving the vision-based detection and labeling of a set of objects.

   description: "Half-day workshop @ICDL-EPIROB 2014 Conference. The goal of the workshop was to <i>explore the possibility of robots developing models inspired by the mechanisms of human body representations</i>. In this way, they can on one hand become new modeling tools for empirical sciences - expanding the domain of computational modeling by anchoring it to the physical environment and a physical body. On the other hand, robot controllers endowed with multimodal whole-body awareness and plasticity typical of humans should give rise to - in robotics unprecedented - autonomy, robustness, and resilience."

## Who am I

Enthusiastic and skillful Software Engineer and Roboticist with more than five years software programming and research experience, and a proven publication track record. Motivated by intellectually challenging projects as well as personal achievements. I love learning new things related with technology and find new goals to motivate myself. I am capable of pursuing individual R&D, but I particularly prefer to be part of a team with bright people working toward ambitious ideas. I love being a perfectionist and hardworking person toward the realization of highly innovative tasks.

## Summary

Raúl Pérula-Martínez was born in Cordoba, Spain, 1988. He received his BSc in [Technical Engineering in Computer Science Systems](http://www.uco.es/eps/node/87) at the [University of Cordoba](http://www.uco.es/) in 2009. In 2011 he completed another BSc in [Computer Science Engineering](http://www.uco.es/eps/node/99)  in the same university. While he was working as Jr. Software Engineer for the company Mirada PLC, he finished his MSc in Robotics and Automation at the [University Carlos III of Madrid](http://www.uc3m.es/) in 2013. In 2012, he started as a member of the [Robotics Society and IEEE Student Branch](http://ieee.uc3m.es/) at the UC3M, being the _Chairman_ since 2014.
Since 2013, he is working in his Ph.D. in _Robotics_ from the same university. During this time he is working in the _Social Robots_ group at the _RoboticsLab_, UC3M. The goal of his Ph.D. project is to exploit insights from neuroscience and psychology in order to implement a model of a **Decision-Making** process for Social Robots based on Human-Robot Interaction. He is also teacher of Robotics and Computer Science.
Since December 2015, he is also collaborating as a Visiting Assistance in Research at the [Social Robotics Lab](http://scazlab.yale.edu/) in Yale University.
