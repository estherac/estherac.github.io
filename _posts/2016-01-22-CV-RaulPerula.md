   description: "I continued the work I started during my Ph.D. fellowship at the iCub Facility. Specifically, I was interested in the exploitation of the peripersonal space model I implemented during my Ph.D., by focusing toward two types of applications: i) better, richer body representations (in collaboration with CITEC @Bielefeld) ii) distributed motor control via whole-body awareness (partially collaborating with WYSIWYD project partners). Furthermore, I extended the gaze stabilization framework I developed during my Ph.D. by integrating it with an existing gaze controller. I was also contributing to a human-robot interaction project aimed at developing natural interaction(s) between the iCub humanoid robot and humans."

   title: Thesis title `Expanding sensorimotor capabilities of humanoid robots through multisensory integration. A study on the implementation of peripersonal space on the iCub.`
   start: 2012
   end: 2015
   location: Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Genova IT
   location-link: http://www.iit.it
   description: "I focused on improving the sensorimotor capabilities of the iCub humanoid, by implementing a bio-inspired system able to learn a multisensory representation of the space around the robot’s body (or <i>peripersonal space</i>). The robot is equipped with a whole-body artificial skin and learns the consequences of its interaction with the self and the environment by means of a multisensory (tactile-motor and tactile-visual) representation. This results in the extension of the robot's tactile domain toward the nearby space, in such a way that it implicitly copes with modeling or calibration errors. Finally, this representation is then exploited with a sensory-based guidance of the motor actions performed by the robot. That is, an avoidance and catching controller capable of using any body part in order to either prevent collision with or come into contact with incoming objects. "

Specifically, I implemented an SVM-based system able to integrate between the visual system and the haptic information coming from the F/T sensor of the iCub robot. The system proved to be successful in improving the vision-based detection of a set of objects by means of the haptic exploration of the same objects."

## Summary

Raúl Pérula-Martínez was born in Cordoba, Spain, 1988. He received his BSc in [Technical Engineering in Computer Science Systems](http://www.uco.es/eps/node/87) at the [University of Cordoba](http://www.uco.es/) in 2009. In 2011 he completed another BSc in [Computer Science Engineering](http://www.uco.es/eps/node/99)  in the same university. While he was working as Jr. Software Engineer for the company Mirada PLC, he finished his MSc in Robotics and Automation at the [University Carlos III of Madrid](http://www.uc3m.es/) in 2013. In 2012, he started as a member of the [Robotics Society and IEEE Student Branch](http://ieee.uc3m.es/) at the UC3M, being the _Chairman_ since 2014.
Since 2013, he is working in his Ph.D. in _Robotics_ from the same university. During this time he is working in the _Social Robots_ group at the _RoboticsLab_ in UC3M, Madrid, under the supervision of professor [Miguel A. Salichs](http://roboticslab.uc3m.es/roboticslab/people/ma-salichs). The goal of his Ph.D. project is to exploit insights from neuroscience and psychology in order to implement a model of a **Decision-Making** process for Social Robots based on Human-Robot Interaction.
Since December 2015, he is also collaborating as a Visiting Assistance in Research at the [Social Robotics Lab](http://scazlab.yale.edu/) in Yale University.
