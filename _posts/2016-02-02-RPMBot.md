Printbots (PRINTable roBOTS) are usually Open Source robots shared to all the world. These robots can be built by a Open Source 3d printer.

## Description

One of my first printbots was the RPMBot (<b><i>Figure 1</i></b>). The RPMBot is a small mobile robot printed by a 3d printer available at the UC3M.

This robot can be printed following the steps published on [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23753). In addition, you can see how it works in the next videos (sorry about the quality).
