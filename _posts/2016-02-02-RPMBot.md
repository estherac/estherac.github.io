Printbots (PRINTable roBOTS) are usually Open Source robots shared to all the world. These robots can be built by a Open Source 3d printer.

## Description

One of my first printbots was the RPMBot (<b><i>Figure 1</i></b>). The RPMBot is a small mobile robot printed by a 3d printer available at the UC3M.
