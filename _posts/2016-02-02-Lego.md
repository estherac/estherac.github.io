The Lego Mindstorms series of kits contain software and hardware to create customizable and programmable robots. They include an intelligent brick computer that controls the system, a set of modular sensors and motors, and Lego parts from the Technic line to create the mechanical systems.

## Description

My first robot built with Lego was a _humanoid robot_ (<b><i>Figure 1</i></b>) in which I implemented a walking.

I also built a robot for the _Teleoperation and Telepresence_ subject at the Master Degree in Robotics and Automation. This robot was a teleoperated manipulator with a 3-axis gyroscope sensor as a remote control.

My last robot was a four wheels car that I built along with my team for the _Mobile Robots_ subject also in the Master degree. For this robot we design from the scratch a robotic car using the Lego design program. After that, we developed a real and simulated system for mapping environments based in ROS.
