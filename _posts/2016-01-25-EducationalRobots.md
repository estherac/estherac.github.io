## Description

Educational robotics is one of the most prosperous fields of study currently. Although expensive educational robotic kits are used in high schools to teach robotics. University students do not have the knowledge base on the matter yet.

More often, low-cost printed modular robots (<b><i>Figure 1</i></b>) are used. 3d printers are the emergent tool to do faster prototypes in a cheaper way. Also, Open Source technologies are the way to share information.

In this paper, we have done a low-cost printed modular robotic platform to teach robotics. Furthermore, we have done several experiments on how to teach educational robotics. Lastly, we have proposed a statistical model to get results from the experiments.
